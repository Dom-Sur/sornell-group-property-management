## 3. AREAS REQUIRING HUMAN INTERACTION üë§

### IMMEDIATE DECISIONS NEEDED

#### 1. Ambiguous Folder Classification
These folders contain 1,178 files needing business rules:
- **BUSINESS_GENERAL** (321 files) - Needs subcategorization rules
- **PERSONAL_PROJECTS** (828 files) - Personal vs business determination
- **CAPEX_SHEETS** (2 files) - Financial categorization needed
- **PROPERTY** (5 files) - Property assignment required
- **REFERENCE_DOCS** (8 files) - Template vs documentation decision
- **SYSTEM_DOCUMENTATION** (3 files) - Tech vs operations classification

#### 2. Baselane Crisis (30-day deadline)
- Cannot change owner email
- Will lose system access in 30 days
- **ACTION REQUIRED**: Migration to alternative platform

#### 3. Financial Document Security
- Tax documents need encryption
- Banking information requires additional access controls
- **DECISION**: Implement encryption layer or separate secure storage

---

## 4. IMPROVEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS üöÄ

2. **Implement file encryption** for sensitive docs (using GPG)
3. **Add audit logging** to track all file operations
4. **Set up automated backups** to 7TB drive (currently manual)

### Medium Term (1 month)
1. **Migrate from Baselane** to alternative platform
2. **Implement RAG system** for intelligent document search
3. **Create team training materials** for new system
