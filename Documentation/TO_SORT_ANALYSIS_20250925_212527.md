I don't see any file mentioned in your message. Could you please provide the files (.e.g., Excel, PDF, etc.) that contain the CAPEX_SHEETS data? I'll be happy to help you determine a suitable SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) location for it.

**ðŸŸ¢ QUICK DECISION: Move to 02_FINANCIAL_MANAGEMENT/08_CAPEX**

For ARCHIVED_ORIGINALS, I recommend storing them in the following locations:

---
Based on the file names and contents, it appears that the files are related to documentation, operations, streaming history, and active documents.

A suitable Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) location for REFERENCE_DOCS could be:

---
The recommended best SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) location is within the "Google Drive Implementation Guide" file (GOOGLE_DRIVE_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md). This makes sense as it's a comprehensive guide that outlines various workflows and procedures related to Google Drive, including the ones listed in the other files.

---
Based on the provided files, I recommend locating the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for "BUSINESS_GENERAL" in the file "TIM BOWLES GREEN COLLECTION 23.xlsx". This Excel file appears to contain a collection of documents and files related to business operations, including an SOP.

**ðŸŸ¡ QUICK DECISION: Split between 05_STRATEGIC_PLANNING and 03_OPERATIONS**
---
Based on the file names, it appears that they are related to a photography project. Here's a suggested SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) location for PERSONAL_PROJECTS:

1. "Personal Project" folder within the photographer's main portfolio or website.

**ðŸ”´ QUICK DECISION: Move to personal backup drive - not business related**
